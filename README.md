Trac to Merlin helper script
============================

 - Trac 0.10.3 (with our custom fields at the moment)
 - Merlin 2.7 ish

Copy the trac.db file to this directory and run trac2merlin.py. A .csv file
is created for each trac milestone. You can drag the file to Merlin and
use the automap feature to import it.
